**TROLL and associated R packages**

This container includes:

-   `TROLL` 4.0.0 (dev)
-   `R` 4.0.3
-   `rcontroll` 0.2.0.9019 (dev)

`rcontroll` integrates the individual-based and spatially-explicit TROLL model to simulate forest ecosystem and species dynamics forward in time. `rcontroll` provides user-friendly functions to set up and analyse simulations with varying community compositions, ecological parameters, and climate conditions.
